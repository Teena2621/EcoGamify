/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GameX Landing application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access and modify their own user account data and associated password reset requests.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /user_accounts/{userAccountId}: Stores user account information.
 * - /user_accounts/{userAccountId}/password_reset_requests/{passwordResetRequestId}: Stores password reset requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is private by default.
 * - Users can only manage password reset requests associated with their account.
 * - The ruleset avoids complex queries and `get()` calls by relying on path-based authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userAccountId` is denormalized into the `PasswordResetRequest` document, enabling rules to quickly verify that the request belongs to the authenticated user without needing extra reads.
