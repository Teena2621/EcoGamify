# **App Name**: GameX Landing

## Core Features:

- Animated Splash Screen: Display an animated photo for 5 seconds on initial page load before transitioning to the main page. The animation style will be selected at random from a collection of fade and slide animations.
- Gamified Environmental Icon: Generate a unique, animated icon with an environmental theme. This logo will incorporate a small degree of randomised game-like elements to capture a sense of playful competition, reflecting GameX project. A generative AI tool will be used to generate this icon. 
- Login/Register Section: Implement a clearly visible 'Login' and 'Register' section on the left side of the page.
- Animated Lecture Slideshow: Create a slideshow displaying animated lectures with colourful pictures, daily challenges, and quizzes. Implement automated slide transitions. Display up to 5 lectures, challenges or quizzes.
- Environmental Game Display: Showcase 4-5 environmental games, each represented by a square image. On clicking the game, redirect the user to the login page.
- Animated Environmental Pictures: Incorporate animated, simple, and cute environmental pictures below the games section. Display between 3 and 5 images using Ken Burns effect animations. This is implemented without AI.
- Contact Details: Provide contact details including a LinkedIn profile link, a landline number, a helpline number, and 2-3 email addresses at the bottom of the page.
